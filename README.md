Hey there, Linux enthusiasts! 👋

I've temporarily switched back to Windows for my 3D printing work, but my heart belongs to Linux. 🐧❤️

I've been working on partially configured my beloved Qtile setup. One of the cool features I was trying to add was a GPU widget for AMD using RadeonMaster. Unfortunately, my 3D printing projects interrupted this endeavor. 🚧🖥️

If anyone out there is interested in adding an AMD GPU widget to Qtile using RadeonMaster, please dive in and give it a shot! Your contributions would mean the world to me. 🌍✨

Rest assured, once my 3D printing work is completed, I'll be back to Linux. It's my forever love, and I can't wait to return to it. 💻❤️

**Linux Forever!** 🐧💖

In this break, I will be making projects about RAG , AI & ML, and now I am creating a project for a college election EVM. Stay tuned!

Feel free to contribute and make this Qtile setup even better. Let's create something amazing together! 🚀
